# Welcome to Witness to Wisdom

### _Witnessing to wisdom for the spiritually independent._

There is a wisdom that runs through many traditions that speaks to the core of who we feel we really are.

This is a place where we witness to this wisdom, and talk about what it might mean in our daily lives.

**Witness to Wisdom** offers resources to enrich our journeys for living a deep and rich spiritual life:

- weekly blog posts with reflections on this wisdom lived in our daily lives. **_COMING SOON_**

- newsletters sent weekly to your inbox so you don't miss a thing. **_FUTURE FEATURE_**

#### I am glad you are here!
