# About Witness to Wisdom

### We serve spiritually independent people on their spiritual journey

You and I are spiritually independent people. We may have grown up in a particular religious tradition or none at all.

We have found a growing sense that there is a deeper reality than what we experienced in the tradition we grew up in. Or maybe we grew up with no tradition at all but just know that reality is deeper and richer than what we had experienced before.

This wisdom runs through these many traditions and experiences. It speaks to the core of what reality is and who we feel we really are.

### Who is behind Witness to Wisdom?

Hi, I am Steven Brauner, the creator of Witness to Wisdom!

I was a pastor in a liberal part of the Christian tradition. I always had an inclusive view of who God's people are. They include Buddhist, Taoist, Hinduist, Islamic, Christian, Agnostic, or anybody else you might name who lives out of joy and love.

This inclusive view has been growing in me over the years. I find myself now on the edge of the Christian family. Most of the time it feels like the inside edge, but since I find I am often more interested in teachings from Buddhist and other traditions I wonder if I have slipped to the outside edge.

I created this site to be a community for the spiritually independent to witness to this wisdom and reality.

### What we offer

This is a place where we witness to this wisdom that is spoken through the many world religions, and talk about what it might mean in our daily lives.
